        "In this kaggle project, We explored the task of predicting obesity risk using a multi-class classification approach.\n",
        "This report outlines the key steps taken in feature engineering, ensemble modeling, and encoding techniques to achieve accurate predictions.\n",
        "# feature engineering\n",
        "In this section, various transformations are applied to preprocess the data and derive new features that could potentially enhance the predictive performance of machine learning models.\n",
        "**Age and Height Rounding**  <br>\n",
        "To facilitate model learning, the 'Age' and 'Height' columns undergo rounding transformations. <br>The 'Age' values are multiplied by 100 and converted to uint16, effectively rounding them to the nearest whole number. Similarly, the 'Height' values are also multiplied by 100 and converted to uint16 to achieve rounding.\n",
        "**Feature Extraction** <br>\n",
        "New features are extracted to provide additional insights into the dataset. Specifically, the 'BMI' (Body Mass Index) feature is computed by dividing the weight by the square of the height. <br>This metric is commonly used to assess an individual's body composition. Additionally, a 'PseudoTarget' feature is created based on the BMI values. The BMI values are segmented into predefined bins, and each observation is assigned a categorical label corresponding to its BMI category.\n",
        "**Column Rounding** <br>\n",
        "Certain columns in the dataset have their values rounded to integers for simplification and standardization. This operation is performed on columns such as 'FCVC', 'NCP', 'CH2O', 'FAF', and 'TUE'. <br>By rounding these numerical values, the model can focus on broader patterns and trends within the data.\n",
        "**Feature Dropping** <br>\n",
        "A custom transformer, known as FeatureDropper, is employed to remove specified columns from the dataset. This allows for the elimination of redundant or irrelevant features that may hinder model performance. <br>The FeatureDropper class is initialized with a list of columns to be dropped, and during the transform process, these columns are excluded from the dataset.\n",
        "# encoding\n",
        "In this code, we primarily used OneHotEncoder and MEstimateEncoder.\n",
        "Looking at the train data, we have a mixture of numerical and categorical columns.\n",
        "Furthermore, the dependent variable we need to predict is categorical, not numerical.\n",
        "Therefore, we encoded the ['Gender', 'family_history_with_overweight', 'FAVC', 'CAEC', 'SMOKE', 'SCC', 'CALC', 'MTRANS'] columns in the train data,\n",
        "and the 'NObeyesdad' column in the test data.\n",
        "MEstimateEncoder is one method for encoding categorical variables. This method encodes each category of the categorical variable using the mean of the target variable for each category. Instead of using the mean of the target variable for each category, MEstimateEncoder calculates the mean of the category with a pre-specified M value. This allows for consistent calculation of the mean for all categories. This method is useful when the number of samples in a category is small or when categories are peculiar.\n",
        "# ensemble\n",
        "We employ an ensemble model consisting of Random Forest Model, LGBM Model, XGB Model, and CatBoost Model. For each model, we utilize Optuna to find the optimal hyperparameters, followed by cross-validation. Additionally, we assign weights to each model and create the final ensemble model. Finally, we compute the accuracy."

The age_rounder and height_rounder functions multiply the 'Age' and 'Height' column values by 100 and convert them to uint16 data type to round them, potentially enhancing model performance. The extract_features function calculates the BMI(Body Mass Index) using 'Weight' and 'Height' columns and adds it as a new feature to the dataframe. Additionally, the col_rounder function rounds specific columns ('FCVC', \"NCP\", \"CH2O\", \"FAF\", \"TUE\") and converts them to integers. Each transformation is encapsulated within a FunctionTransformer object. Lastly, the FeatureDropper class is a custom transformer that drops specified columns from the input DataFrame, allowing for further customization of the data preprocessing pipeline."

It constructs a CatBoost pipeline with the optimized parameters and performs cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance. The CatBoost pipeline includes feature extraction, categorical encoding, and CatBoost classifier instantiation. After defining the objective function, an Optuna study object cat_study is created to maximize the objective function. Additionally, a set of initial hyperparameters for the CatBoost model is specified. Finally, the CatBoost model is trained using cross-validation, and the validation and test predictions are stored in respective dataframes for further analysis. This code provides a comprehensive framework for optimizing and training CatBoost models."
